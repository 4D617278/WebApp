# Running WebApp for the First Time
[Go back to Readme Home](../../README.md)

Please make sure you have read:

* [Preparing the Environment on Your Machine](ENVIRONMENT.md)

* [Bringing Code to Your Machine](CLONING_CODE.md)

Note that for the following steps, you must have activated the `WebAppEnv` Node virtual environment that you set up when preparing your environment. As a reminder, to activate the environment, you can run:

    $ cd /Users/<YOUR NAME HERE>/NodeEnvironments/WebAppEnv/
    $ . bin/activate

## Local config.js file

Every developer needs to maintain their own `WebApp/src/js/config.js` file, which can be copied from `WebApp/src/js/config-template.js`. The default configuration, copied from `config-template.js`, should work as-is for new developers.

Copy `WebApp/src/js/config-template.js` into `WebApp/src/js/config.js`:

    (WebAppEnv) $ cd /Users/<YOUR NAME HERE>/MyProjects/WebApp
    (WebAppEnv) $ cp src/js/config-template.js src/js/config.js
    (WebAppEnv) $ cp tests/browserstack/browserstack.config-template.js tests/browserstack/browserstack.config.js

## Mac users will need to install fsevents ("Native access to OS X FSEvents in Node.js"): 

    (WebAppEnv) $ cd /Users/<YOUR NAME HERE>/MyProjects/WebApp
    (WebAppEnv) $ npm install fsevents

## Install and start web application

    (WebAppEnv) $ cd /Users/<YOUR NAME HERE>/MyProjects/WebApp
    (WebAppEnv) $ npm install      // try sudo if it does not work
    (WebAppEnv) $ npm start

You should be able to visit WebApp here:

    http://localhost:3000
    

(If you would like to run the WebApp on a different port follow [these instructions](CHANGE_PORT.md))


## Using We Vote API server Locally: OPTIONAL

The default configuration connections to our live API server at: https://api.wevoteusa.org, so this step is optional.

If you would like to install the We Vote API server locally, start by reading the instructions to 
[install WeVoteServer](https://github.com/wevote/WeVoteServer/blob/master/README_API_INSTALL.md).
